  <h1>Emerald Ash Borer</h1>
  <img src="images/Ash.jfif" alt="Emerald Ash Borer">
<p>The <strong>Emerald Ash Borer</strong> is a green jewel beetle native to north-eastern Asia that feeds on ash trees.
     Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults
     in one to two years. In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant
     damage to trees native to the area. Outside its native range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive
     to ash trees native to northwest Europe and North America. Prior to being found in North America,
     very little was known about emerald ash borer in its native range; this has resulted in much of
     the research on its biology being focused in North America. Local governments in North America
     are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control.</p>
